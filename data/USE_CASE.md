# Stock Market Simulator — File I/O with BufferedReader & BufferedWriter
# Streams Lab
This demo shows two Java programs that communicate via a file to simulate two machines exchanging messages. The writer program, **MarketDataGenerator**, uses a `BufferedWriter` to append newline-delimited JSON “ticks” (timestamp, symbol, price, volume) to `data/ticks.ndjson`. The reader program, **TradingDashboard**, uses a `BufferedReader` to continuously ingest that file, maintain a rolling window of recent prices, display an ASCII mini-chart, and compute a simple moving average. This meets the assignment’s requirement to read and write using buffered streams and demonstrates a realistic pipeline (market feed → dashboard). In a future version, the exact same reader/writer logic can be swapped from files to network sockets so the two programs can run on different machines and exchange messages over TCP.
 # Threads Lab
 This threaded simulation mimics a live stock market data feed and dashboard. The MarketDataGenerator thread continuously generates random price updates for two stock symbols (ABC and XYZ) and writes them to a shared .ndjson file. Simultaneously, the TradingDashboard thread reads from this file in real-time, calculates a simple moving average (SMA), and displays ASCII mini-charts of the price history. Threads run concurrently without blocking each other, demonstrating how concurrent systems can model real-world applications like financial dashboards, sensor data monitors, or event-driven simulators.
